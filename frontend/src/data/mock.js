Soumi, a spirited Bengali dreamer chasing her MBA, and James, an Army Captain trading battlefields for business school. She remembers thinking he'd never crack a smile. He remembers thinking she was way out of his league. A canceled lunch brought them to the same table, and slowly, the serious one started to smile."

Their first real date at Howies restaurant, followed by moonlit walks along ancient streets. When Soumi finally saw the city she'd only imagined through Harry Potter books, tears of pure joy streamed down her face. James held space for her quietly, and in that moment, both knew - this was more than friendship. Saying goodbye at the train station, watching her face through the window as it pulled away, James felt fear of losing something precious. They'd found each other.",

On a crisp autumn day at Colchester Castle Park, surrounded by their closest friends, he got down on one knee with a sparkling ring. Six months of video calls, of longing, of counting days - all leading to this magical moment. The friends who had watched their love story unfold from the very beginning were there to witness it. Time stood still. Her heart raced. He asked. She said yes.",
